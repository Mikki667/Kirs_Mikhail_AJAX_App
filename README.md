# Kirs_Mikhail_AJAX_App
This project is a dynamic product page for the Novo Earbuds. It uses SASS, the Fetch API, and the HTML template element to load data from an external API. The hotspots on the 3D model and the materials section are populated with JSON data on page load. A loading spinner and basic error handling were added for the AJAX requests. The page also includes a mobile layout where a static image is shown instead of the 3D model.
