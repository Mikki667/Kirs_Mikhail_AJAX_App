# Kirs_Mikhail_AJAX_App

## Overview

This project is a dynamic product page for the Novo Earbuds. It uses SASS, the Fetch API, and the HTML template element to load data from an external API. The hotspots on the 3D model and the materials section are populated with JSON data on page load. A loading spinner and basic error handling were added for the AJAX requests. The page also includes a mobile layout where a static image is shown instead of the 3D model.

## Features
- Loads hotspot text from the API  
- Loads materials from the API using the `<template>` element  
- Shows a loading spinner while data is being fetched  
- Displays an error message if the data fails to load  
- Static image on mobile and the 3D model on tablet/desktop
